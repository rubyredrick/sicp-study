;Exercise 1.42.  Let f and g be two one-argument functions. 
; The composition f after g is defined to be the function x  f(g(x)). 
; Define a procedure compose that implements composition. 
; For example, if inc is a procedure that adds 1 to its argument,

; ((compose square inc) 6)
; 49

(define (inc x)
  (+ 1 x))

(define (square x) (* x x))

(define (compose f g)
  (lambda (x) (f (g x))))

((compose square inc) 6)
