Exercise 1.4.  Observe that our model of evaluation allows for combinations whose operators are compound expressions. Use this observation to describe the behavior of the following procedure:

(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
  ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))
  
The if expression will return one of two atoms + or - depending on whether b is greater than zero or not.

So if a is positive the result will be (+ a b) but if it's negative the result will be (- a b)
